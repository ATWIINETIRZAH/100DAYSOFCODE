# 100DAYSOFCODE
Welcome to my "100 Days of Code" challenge! This is a personal commitment to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. The goal is to improve my coding skills, work on projects, and build consistency in my coding practice.

During this challenge, I aim to:
 Learn a new programming language or framework.
 Build a personal project from start to finish.
 Contribute to open-source projects.
 Improve problem-solving skills through coding challenges.
 Enhance my understanding of web development.
 
 Rules
Coding Daily: I will dedicate at least one hour every day to coding.
Logging Progress: I will maintain a daily log to record what I worked on, challenges faced, and any insights gained.
GitHub Commit: I will make at least one meaningful commit to a GitHub repository every day.
Learning and Building: I will focus on learning new technologies, working on projects, and achieving coding goals.
Community Engagement: I will engage with the coding community, share my progress, and support fellow coders.

 This challenge is a personal journey of growth and learning. It's important to stay committed, but don't be discouraged by occasional setbacks. They are opportunities for improvement.
